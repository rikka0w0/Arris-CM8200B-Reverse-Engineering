 * \brief Register tracking type definitions
 *
 * The register track module provides functionality to comprehensively debug
 * register level transactions.  It is a slow interface that should be used in
 * parallel to standard direct read/write transactions.  The module can parse
 * registers into easy read field format.  Registers may be looked up by name
 * or address.

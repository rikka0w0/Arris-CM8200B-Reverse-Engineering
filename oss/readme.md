This directory contains Commscope 8200 Cable Modem Open Source Software as per [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rikka0w0/Arris-CM8200B-Reverse-Engineering/issues/2). The files are [`split`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/1589) and so will need to be `cat` (concatenated) before the contents can be read/extracted. Files are described as the following:  
  
* 8200_OSS.zip* - split file that is from the sourceforge link above (via GitHub issue)
* 8200_OSS.tar.xz* - split xz tarball with contents from the original sourceforge hosted file extracted and recompressed into XZ. Also contains the README.txt and the description text as found on sourceforge
* 8200_OSS.squashfs* - split squashfs variant of xz tarball above
* SHA512SUMS - SHA-512 sums for file verification on the split files to ensure successful reading/extraction
